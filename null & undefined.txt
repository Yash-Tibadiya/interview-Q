We talk a lot about null and undefined in
JavaScript , do you understand what
exactly those terms are ? and what is
the difference between those?


undefined
var a;       ( we not give a value to "a" )

null
i have one string "sky" and i write code to find "i" in the string 
code gives output "null"
